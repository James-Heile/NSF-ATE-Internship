{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Moreyball - Exploring the Impact of Analytics on the NBA \n","\n","**Project Overview:**<br>\n","This project aims to explore how data analytics has influenced strategy in the modern NBA, focusing on three key areas:\n","\n","1. Shot selection<br>\n","3. Offensive efficiency<br>\n","3. Player evaluation and usage<br>\n","\n","Inspired by Billy Beane's \"Moneyball\" story in baseball, this project focuses on its NBA counterpart, particularly the analytics movement led by former Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey. Rather than analyzing the Rockets specifically, this project looks at league-wide trends that have emerged following Morey's influence since the mid 2000's.\n","\n","**Objectives:**<br>\n","* Investigate how NBA strategy has shifted due to the rise of analytics\n","* Create data visualizations to support exploratory (descriptive) analysis\n","* Consider the ongoing debate around whether analytics has improved or diminished the entertainment and fundamentals of the sport\n","\n","**Tools/Resources:**<br>\n","* Python\n","* Pandas\n","* Kaggle NBA Datasets\n","* Basketball-Reference (POTENTINALLY)\n","* NBA API (GitHub - swar/nba_api) (POTENTIALLY)\n","\n","**Disclaimer:**<br>\n","As someone newer to coding and data analysis, this project will also serve as a learning experience. I hope to accomplish all of my goals over the coming weeks, but I may have to pivot the projects direction as I go along.
