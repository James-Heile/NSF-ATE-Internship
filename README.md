# Moreyball - Exploring the Impact of Analytics on the Modern NBA 

**Project Overview:**<br>
This project aims to explore how data analytics has influenced strategy in the modern NBA, focusing on three key areas:

1. Shot selection<br>
3. Offensive efficiency<br>
3. "Foul-bating"<br>

Inspired by Billy Beane's "Moneyball" story in baseball, this project focuses on its NBA counterpart, particularly the analytics movement led by former Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey.

**Objectives:**<br>
* Investigate how NBA strategy has shifted due to the rise of analytics
* Create data visualizations to support exploratory (descriptive) analysis
* Consider the ongoing debate around whether analytics has improved or diminished the entertainment and fundamentals of the sport

**Tools/Resources:**<br>
* Python
* Pandas
* Kaggle's NBA Datasets

**Note:**<br>
This repository contains two versions of the notebook:

1. The rough working draft, where I explored ideas, wrote initial code, and worked through challenges.
2. The final polished notebook, which presents a cleaner, more organized version of the analysis and findings.

I included both to provide insight into my full thought process from start to finish.
