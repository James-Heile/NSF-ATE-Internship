Inspired by the success of Billy Beane’s application of analytics in baseball, Morey helped bring a data-driven mindset to the NBA during the 2003 to 2007 seasons. During this time with the Boston Celtics and Houston Rockets, Morey emphasized efficiency above all, valuing three-point shots, layups, and free throws while minimizing inefficient mid-range jumpers. His philosophy sparked both admiration and criticism, but it undeniably reshaped how teams evaluate players, build rosters, and run offenses.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, analytics has become a core part of nearly every NBA front office. The ripple effects are clear: leaguewide, there has been a dramatic rise in three-point attempts, pace of play, and positionless basketball. Yet for longtime fans, the shift is not always welcomed. My grandma, who has been an NBA fan for the past 40 years, now finds the modern game somewhat harder to enjoy. She often notes during games that there are \"too many whistles\" and that \"everyone just jacks up threes.\" Her sentiment echoes the feelings of a broad range of fans as analytics continue to create tension between innovation and tradition, redefining how basketball is enjoyed and played.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, for my project, I plan to analyze the periods before, during, and after the 2003 to 2007 Moreyball seasons to see whether fan sentiments related to \"foul-baiting\", heavier three pointer reliance, and play style changes are supported by publicly available NBA statistics. By examining trends in shot selection, pace, foul rates, and efficiency, I aim to better understand how analytics have reshaped the game and whether those changes align with or diverge from the preferences of longtime fans like my grandma.<br>\n\n**Project Overview:**<br>\nHowever, rather than analyzing Morey's Celtics/Rockets specifically, I instead plan to investigate league-wide trends that have emerged following Morey's influence since the mid 2000's, focusing on three key areas:\n\n1. Shot selection<br>\n3. Offensive efficiency<br>\n3. \"Foul-baiting\"<br>\n\n**Objectives:**<br>\n* Investigate how NBA strategy has shifted due to the rise of analytics\n* Create data visualizations to support exploratory (descriptive) analysis\n* Consider the ongoing debate around whether analytics has improved or diminished the entertainment and fundamentals of the sport\n\n**Tools/Resources:**<br>\n* Python\n* Pandas\n* Kaggle NBA Datasets\n\n**DISCLAIMER:**<br>\nAs someone newer to coding and data analysis, this project will also serve as a learning experience. I hope to accomplish all of my goals over the coming weeks, but I may have to pivot the projects direction as I go along. Consequently, I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or resources that might help shape this project.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Initialization:**<br>\nThe code below initializes the environment by importing the necessary libraries and confirming that my datasets have been loaded properly.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport os \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nprint(os.listdir('/kaggle/input/basketball'))\nprint(os.listdir('/kaggle/input/nba-aba-baa-stats'))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-22T00:41:22.134979Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-22T00:41:22.135308Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-22T00:41:22.154576Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-22T00:41:22.135260Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-22T00:41:22.153378Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Dataset Testing:**<br>\nThe next few blocks explore the \"basketball\" dataset to better understand its structure, utilizing the display.max function to efficiently identify its most useful columns.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#datset 1 function utilization\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/basketball/csv/game.csv', parse_dates=['game_date'])\n\ndf.shape","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-22T00:42:49.546956Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-22T00:42:49.547246Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-22T00:42:50.061244Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-22T00:42:49.547224Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-22T00:42:50.060485Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-22T00:42:59.555839Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-22T00:42:59.556514Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-22T00:42:59.613313Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-22T00:42:59.556486Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-22T00:42:59.612450Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.tail()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-22T00:43:15.036390Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-22T00:43:15.036686Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-22T00:43:15.085407Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-22T00:43:15.036662Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-22T00:43:15.084366Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**1.

Namely, 3P shooting has definitely taken off, as teams are launching more threes than ever before, which matches what Morey believed about focusing on efficient shots. So when my grandma says, “everyone just jacks up threes,” she’s not wrong. The numbers back that up.\n\n2. Moreover, offensive efficiency has steadily improved over time, with teams getting more out of each possession by prioritizing smarter and more purposeful shot selection. The pace of the game has also accelerated, leading to more possessions and greater scoring opportunities. In other words, the shift in play style is not arbitrary. It reflects a strategic effort to maximize efficiency. So, even if my grandma misses the days of post-ups and mid-range artistry, the data makes a strong case that today’s 3P-heavy offenses are, in many ways, simply more effective.\n\n   *That said, efficiency hasn’t skyrocketed in the same way that three-point attempts have. The rise in offensive output is real, but it’s growing at a much slower pace compared to the explosion in 3P shooting. So while teams are scoring better, the surge in threes seems to be outpacing the gains in efficiency, which suggests that the league might still be figuring out the true sweet spot between volume and value.\n\n3. Lastly, fouling rates have actually remained fairly steady over time, and in some seasons have even declined slightly compared to the 1990s. That might come as a surprise to many NBA fans who often describe today’s game as “softer” and feel like there are too many whistles slowing things down. While that perception isn’t strongly supported by the raw foul numbers, what has changed is how fouls are drawn. Modern players have become incredibly skilled at manipulating defenders into fouling, using slick footwork, abrupt stops, and sometimes a bit of acting to get to the free-throw line. This kind of foul-baiting has become part of the strategy, and while it’s effective, it can also make the game feel more fragmented and less physical than it once was. So even if the numbers don’t show a rise in fouling, the way fouls are used and perceived has evolved, and that is likely what fans are really reacting to.\n\nIn the end, the data tells a story of a league transformed by analytics. Its faster, more efficient, and more focused on three-point shooting. Some longtime fans might struggle with these changes, but others might appreciate how the game has evolved to be more strategic and high-scoring. My grandma’s feelings capture that tension perfectly, as she’s right about the shift in style and shot selection but maybe a little off on her critique of fouling. It’s a reminder that data and experience can sometimes tell different parts of the story.\n\nOverall, working on this project was not only a great learning experience but also a lot of fun. Diving into the numbers helped me better understand how basketball has evolved and gave me a chance to explore the real impact of analytics on the game I love.","metadata":{}}]}
